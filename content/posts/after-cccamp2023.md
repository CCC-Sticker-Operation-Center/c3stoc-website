We realize we are a bit late with this post, but hey, better late than never. Remember, like 6 weeks ago? There was a larger [CCC hacker camp](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2023/) a little north of Berlin. Pretty wild, we know.

Anyways, both of us have been there, and we were overwhelmed. We have found so many creative stickers, and there probably are many more that we didn’t even find. Thank you so much for bringing them, and for sharing them with everyone else.

We would also like to thank any villages, groups or individuals who provided boxes for exchanging stickers. They were lots of fun to browse through and sparked interesting conversations between visitors. Announcing additional boxes via Mastodon seems to have worked well, and I’m pretty sure I’ve seen a news post in the Engelsystem which kept updating to add new ones from the comments.

We distributed stickers that were given to us into your exchange boxes, while still trying to preserve their unique flavor. Our success was admittedly somewhat mixed due to the amount of stickers we were supplied. And we still had to mail a good chunk of them back home so we can share them at future events.  
Unfortounately, **I THINK** none of us managed to visit any of the community events since then, and the next one will likely be congress.

Few people sent us stickers via mail directly to Camp. That probably means most of you who printed stickers, could either attend the event, or missed the announcement and found someone else to help you out.  
Only one hackspace managed to drop stickers off at Chaos Post despite our announcement that we’re NOT running a central drop-off-point for this event. We still picked them up and and are holding on to them for future events.

Thank you also for attendeding our talk, if you managed to find the time. The recording is available [here](https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2023-57194-from_c3stoc_with_love_3). The slides we made are licensed under **LICENSE** and can be downloaded **[here](LINK TO THE SLIDES)**.

The reasons that keep us from visiting other events recently also prevented us from working on the “How to sticker” guide we promised you. Also keep in mind, that *both* our laptops gave up one way or another just a week or so before camp. This made it hard to work on it during the event and also created additional work (and stress).  
We aim to release the guide in *shortly* so you will have enough time to make use of it for your congress stickers. Although it’s a good idea to start thinking about design ideas already, if you haven’t yet ;)

If you have feedback for us regarding our talk, have input for the howto or just generally want to tell us something, feel free to get in touch using the contact methods we linked.

That’s it, see you soon!
