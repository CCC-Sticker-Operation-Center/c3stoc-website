After taking a break last year, we're getting ready for c3stoc at 39c3! 

We’ve done this a couple of times by now and we don’t plan to make any big changes. As usual, we’ll make sure there are sticker boxes spread across the event, with fresh stickers regularly delivered to them. 

### In short, this is how the Sticker Operation Center works:

We are currently planning sticker boxes (exchange points) across the CCH. If you would like to run a sticker box at your assembly, [read the guidelines first](/39c3-c3stoc-stickerbox-guidelines.pdf) and please send us a private message on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@c3stoc) or [send us an email](mailto:exchange@stickeroperation.center). 
We will announce the locations of the sticker exchange points shortly before Congress starts.
You will then be able to either drop stickers directly into the boxes or bring them to Chaos Post to have them delivered to the exchange points.

In the meantime, we look forward to seeing pictures of your designs on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@c3stoc) — tag us and we'll share them! If you’re still working on your designs, take a look at our [guide](https://stickeroperation.center/how-to-sticker/).


### And as usual, a short FAQ:

**I want my assembly to have a sticker box. What should I do?**

That's great! Please let us know as soon as possible, either [by email](mailto:exchange@stickeroperation.center) or via a [private message on chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@c3stoc). We'll get back to you as soon as we've decided where to put the boxes. If we receive more requests than we can handle, we will have to select which assemblies receive a box.

[We have guidelines for assemblies who want to run a sticker box](39c3-c3stoc-stickerbox-guidelines.pdf) – please make sure you read them carefully! You will have to explicitly agree to the rules, as we had some issues last time.

Of course, if we don't approve your box, it doesn't mean that your assembly shouldn't have a sticker exchange. The more, the better! It just means that we won't be distributing stickers to it, as we can't handle too many boxes. However, we're sure that people will find it and fill it!

**I want to create some stickers this year. Can you help?**

We can't design or print them for you, but we're happy to help where we can. To avoid repeating ourselves, we created the [sticker making guide](https://stickeroperation.center/how-to-sticker/) mentioned in our post above. Have a look at it; it should answer most of your questions. If not, you can contact us on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@c3stoc) or [via email](mailto:exchange@stickeroperation.center).
We're also happy to take a look at your design if you're not sure about it, so feel free to send us a picture of what you'd like to print. 

**I have ideas for c3stoc, I like stickers and I have time. Can I help?**

We already have a small team for this year and are unsure if we need more people, but it's good to know about potential helping hands, so get in touch! If you have any other ideas, we can discuss them and work out together whether they are realistically doable without causing additional work or creating issues. Even if it doesn't work out this year, we'd still love to hear what other sticker enthusiasts want to do.
Also, we recommend supporting ChaosPost as a Chaos Carrier. They're awesome and they're playing an important role in the c3stoc infrastructure: help them deliver stickers to the boxes, or if there are none to deliver, deliver some postcards for them! You can check out their website at [chaospost.de](https://chaospost.de/).

**I am not attending Congress. Can you mail me stickers as you used to?**

Unfortunately not. We only did that when there was no in-person event. We understand that not everyone can attend and we would love to help, but unfortunately we don't have the capacity to deal with that on top of our usual in-person event activities. The remote exchanges were very time-consuming and stressful, and we’re quite relieved to be back to our initial mode.

**I won't be attending Congress or I will be there but won't be able to carry my stickers with me. Can I send you some stickers to distribute on my behalf?**

Unfortunately, we can’t offer that service. We are travelling to Congress by train and are struggling to bring large amounts of our own stickers already.
